  #basics  
    %h2 Basic principles
    %ul
      %li Hackspedition should be open and non-exclusive.
      %li There should be space and time to do some actual social hacking.
      %li There should be leisure/adventure activities that have nothing to do with computers.
      %li The event should involve at least two communities from two different geographies
  #guidelines  
    %h2 Guidelines
    %ol
      %li Organize a three to five day trip. One of the communities can host the other community
      %li Don't bother to  book hotel rooms. Ideally, guest hackers can borrow a couch or mattress from host hackers.  
      %li A welcome party is awesome. Reserve a small bar and go for a couple of drinks together the first night.
      %li Sightseeing is good, exploration is better. Most hackers are very curious people regardless the situation. Give them enough materials to make the experience as insightful as possible.
      %li Mix, mix, mix. The whole point of Hackspeditions is to cross-pollinate. Do whatever is necessary to beat language or interpersonal barriers.
      %li Mind about cultural differences. Take some time to discuss the agenda with people from both communities.
      %li Hack together. Try to have a SuperHappyDevHouse or similar event built into the event.
      %li Push your limits. People really get fond of each other when they live intense experiences together. Adventure activities such as rafting, hiking or canoeing are perfect to achieve this.
      %li Run a wrap up session. Make sure everybody is aware of the achievements made during the Hackspedition. Also make sure people have the means to stay in touch.
      %li Do. Learn. Share. Iterate.
